{"name":"Meta-Amplicon Analysis Project","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to our Meta-Amplicon Analysis Project page\r\n\r\nWe present a novel method of marker analysis of microbial data: clustering analysis of microbial communities using multiple genomic markers. This is the calibration of markers using data from known microbial genomes.\r\n\r\n### Why one should use our method?\r\n\r\nHigh-throughput sequencing technologies allow researchers to characterize microbial community composition and structure without cultivation. There are two current approaches in analysis of microbial communities: metagenomic and genomic marker sequencing. Metagenomic analysis employs shotgun sequencing following by optional assembly. Marker sequencing clusters amplicon sequences by similarity into operational taxonomic units (OTU). The limitation of OTU method: (1) sensitive to sequence noise; (2) Different clusters for different markers; (3) Combining data from different markers is not easy.\r\n\r\n### Software application\r\nWe developed a software application MetAmp that performs the meta-amplicon analysis. The MetAmp is a set of scripts and packages and ready to use after the installation. The general requirements are: Python 2.7, Biopython, R and GCC. The input data and other parameters should be provided in configuration file config.R. To run the program, simply execute the file ’main.R’ from R-environment: source(”main.R”). Most MetAmp parameters can be left to default for majority of tasks.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
